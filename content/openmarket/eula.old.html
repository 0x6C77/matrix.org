As such it allows sending an instant message from a Matrix client to a mobile phone who will receive it as an SMS and vice versa: send an SMS from a mobile phone to a virtual number linked to a Matrix user who will receive it as a Matrix instant message  in his Matrix client.
In order to use the OpenMarket Matrix API or make use of the services provided by OpenMarket through this API (the “Service” or “Services”), You (hereinafter referred to as “You”, “Your” or “Yourself”) must first read this agreement (the “Agreement”) and accept it. If you accept or agree to this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to this Agreement and, in such event, “you”, “your” and “yourself” will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity.
