Hello Matrix Bot,Alexander Rudyk,https://gitlab.com/argit/hello-matrix-bot,bot,,Bot with an array of plugins,Alpha,,JavaScript,Apache,Yes,,"This project is a simple attempt at providing a friendly face to as many popular services as possible, making them accessible from any Matrixroom. ""Hello Matrix"" is written as NodeJS application, building on matrix-js-sdk, the JavaScript SDK from the creators of Matrix. It is a hobby project and as such far from feature complete, in fact it is all very basic right now - hopefully this will change over the coming months.

You can either use the ""Hello Matrix"" bot running on our server (just invite @hello-matrix:matrix.org into your Matrix room) or you can check out the code from this repository and run your own instance of ""Hello Matrix"" (also providing your own API keys to the services you want to use).

""Hello Matrix"" currently supports the following services:

* Sending and receiving messages using Bitmessage
* Numeric calculations using Wolfram Alpha
* Throwing the dice (generating a random number)
* Adding tasks to your Kanban board from Kanban Tool and getting notified of task status changes
* Tracerouting a given IP
* Weather from OpenWeatherMap
* Providing WHOIS information on a domain or IP address
* Adding tasks and monitoring progress on Wunderlist lists
* The goal is to add at least generic web hook functionality in the coming months, which would immediately make a large number of other integrations possible. We’ll keep you updated on any progress.

Matrix Live,Alexander Rudyk,https://gitlab.com/argit/matrix-live/,other,,Liveblogging based on Matrix,Beta,,JavaScript,Apache,Yes,,"Liveblogging is reporting about events -- with text and pictures -- as they happen. Matrix is a new, powerful messaging platform for instant communication. We believe the two belong together. That's why we have created Matrix Live.

With Matrix Live, you can create a room in Matrix, and while you use your favorite Matrix client (such as Riot) to write text and post pictures in this room, your users will see them appear live on the web - either here or right on your blog or website.

How does it look like in practice? You can try it out. We have prepared two demo versions for you, which are both fully functional Matrix Live implementations - check them out [here](https://live.hello-matrix.net/live.html#matrix.hello-matrix.net/!sBcCeweWXOjVViEiIY%3Ahello-matrix.net/Hello%2C%20Matrix!) and [here](https://live.hello-matrix.net/demo2.html).

Matrix Recorder,Alexander Rudyk,https://gitlab.com/argit/matrix-recorder/,other,,Enables you to keep a record of all messages you have received.,Alpha,,JavaScript,MIT,Yes,,"While Matrix homeservers store your message history so that you can retrieve them on all your devices, currently there is no easy way to download and backup this message history. This is especially relevant for end-to-end (E2E) encrypted rooms because their history cannot be decrypted anymore if you lose your encryption keys (which is as easy as logging out of your Riot client).

This is where Matrix Recorder jumps in. This tool (written in Node.js) retrieves all messages you receive or send just as a regular client would. It uses your existing Matrix account but registers as a new device with its own encryption keys, which means that it can decrypt messages sent to you after Matrix Recorder has been registered. You don’t need to keep it running all the time but can just start it from time to time - it will continue from where it left off when you start it the next time.

All timeline events retrieved that way will be stored in an sqlite database which you can just keep as a backup or use to create your own archive. Matrix Recorder comes with a small utility that extracts messages from this database into HTML files that can be viewed in your browser.

First, get the code from CPAN:

```
$ cpan Circle
$ cpan Circle::Net::Matrix

$ cpan Circle::FE::Term
```

Now you can run the backend. Personally I keep UNIX sockets in `$HOME/var/run` but of course feel free to use whatever path you like.

```
$ mkdir -p ~/var/run
$ cd circle-be
$ ./circle-be --socket ~/var/run/circle.sock
```

Now you can run the frontend, which connects to the backend server via ssh and connects to that UNIX socket.

```
$ cd circle-fe-term
$ ./circle-fe-term sshunix://server/var/run/circle.sock
```

Then in the Global tab, create a new Matrix network:

```
/networks add -type matrix Matrix
```

Then in the new MyNet tab for that network, configure it and connect:

```
/set homeserver example.org
/set user_id @me:example.org
/set access_token MDAxABCDE...

/connect
```

(for now, you'll have to steal the access token from another Matrix client, such as Riot or [App::MatrixTool](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::MatrixTool))",2017-05-02-circle.md,,,

## synapse_janitor.sql
Cleans a synapse Postgres database of deleted messages and abandoned rooms.

### Deleted Messages
If a message was sent in matrix and is then deleted (or *redacted* in technical parlance) it is not displayed but it is not removed from the server either. This script removes it.

### Abandoned Rooms
If a room has been joined by someone on your homeserver but currently nobody on your homeserver is using it, this script will remove all traces of that room. **NOTE**: It will cause the room to disappear from people's ""historical"" section of old rooms.
This can improve performance significantly.

### Using this script
This script should be run from the command line while synapse server is stopped.

```
psql -Umatrix synapse < synapse_janitor.sql
```

## synapse_dumper.sh
Allows easy backup of a matrix postgres database by dumping it to a compressed file.

## synapse_startloop.sh
Script which starts up synapse if it is not running. **NOTE**: This is configured for a matrix server which has the synchrotron
worker enabled, if you do not use the synchrotron, just comment the block at the bottom.

## Using these scripts

The startloop and the dumper are appropriate for use in crontab:

```
* * * * * /home/matrix/synapse_scripts/synapse_startloop.sh 2>&1 >>/home/matrix/synapse_startloop.log
0 3 * * * /home/matrix/synapse_scripts/synapse_dumper.sh 2>&1 >>/home/matrix/synapse_dumper.log
