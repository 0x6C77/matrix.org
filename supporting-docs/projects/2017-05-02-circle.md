# {{ page.title }}
Circle is an IRC & Matrix client which merges the best attributes of a local client and the common screen+irssi recipe.

 * Keep IRC connects and state on a backend server, allowing disconnections from local UI.
 * Interact with a real local GUI for the frontend, instead of incurring SSH roundtrips for every keypress.
