# {{ page.title }}
mxisd is an implementation of the Matrix Identity Server which aims to provide an alternative to [sydent](https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent) and an external validation implementation of the [Identity Service API](http://matrix.org/docs/spec/identity_service/unstable.html).

mxisd is currently in read-only mode and use a priority lookup strategy with several providers.

Given the 3PID ```john.doe@example.org```, the following would be performed in priority order until a mapping is found:

LDAP: lookup the Matrix ID from an configurable attribute.
DNS: lookup another Identity Server using the domain part of an e-mail and:
Look for a SRV record under ```_identity._matrix._tcp.example.org```
Lookup using the base domain name ```example.org```
Forwarder: Proxy the request to other identity servers (```matrix.org``` and ```vector.im``` currently hardcoded).

Follow the progress and grab the code from [GitHub](https://github.com/kamax-io/mxisd).
