# {{ page.title }}
The integrations manager in Riot is the piece that provides an easy way to add bots, bridges, widgets, and more to your room. Dimension replaces Riot's default manager, Modular, and offers the option of self-hosting your own integrations. Dimension offers a generic interface for custom solutions to be added and acts as the UI for configuring the various integrations you host.
