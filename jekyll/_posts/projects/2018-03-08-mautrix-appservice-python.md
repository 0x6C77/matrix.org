# {{ page.title }}
mautrix-appservice-python is an application service framework written in asyncio Python.

The framework is minimal and only provides basic application service functions,
room state storage and an intent API. The core AS functions are based on Cadair's
[python-appservice-framework](https://github.com/Cadair/python-appservice-framework/)
and the intent API design is based on matrix-appservice-bridge.
