# {{ page.title }}
Webring software built on top of Matrix.org which means it doesn't have a central point of failure.

Check it out at [Ryan's blog](http://whatthefuck.computer/blog/2015/12/06/polynomial-a-decentralized-webring/) and grab the code from [Ryan's git repo](https://fort.kickass.systems/git/rrix/polynomial)
