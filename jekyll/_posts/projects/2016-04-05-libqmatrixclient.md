# {{ page.title }}
libqmatrixclient is a Qt-based library to make IM clients for the Matrix protocol. It is used by [Quaternion](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/client/quaternion.html) and is a part of the QMatrixClient project. Recent builds of [Tensor](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/client/tensor.html) are also made on top of libqmatrixclient.

The project lives in QMatrixClient [github space](https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient).
