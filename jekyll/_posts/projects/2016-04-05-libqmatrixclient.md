# {{ page.title }}
libqmatrixclient is a Qt-based library to make IM clients for the Matrix protocol. [Quaternion](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/client/quaternion.html) is a reference client using its features; together with the library they form the [QMatrixClient](https://github.com/QMatrixClient) project. Recent builds of [Tensor](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/client/tensor.html) are made on top of this SDK; another notable client using it is [uMatriks](https://github.com/LarreaMikel/uMatriks).

The project lives in QMatrixClient [GitHub space](https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient).
