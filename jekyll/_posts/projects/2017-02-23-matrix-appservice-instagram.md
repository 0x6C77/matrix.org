# {{ page.title }}

matrix-appservice-instagram bridges Instagram media to Matrix rooms. Due to limitations with Instagram, it cannot handle direct messages and requires authorization in order to post media to a room. Useful for brands looking to populate their rooms with their Instagram posts.

The source (and more information) can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-appservice-instagram).
